## Project from an Udemy course
I tried to see how well I understand the tutorials. I decided to see how far I could go in attempting to build the game without watching the instructor's solution. 
I am so excited	:smiley: that I was able to implement all the functionalities by myself.

### How to play
+ The game is for two players. 
+ You roll a dice in turns. 
+ For a turn, you can roll as many time as you wish but the risk is that you are forced to switch turns when you roll a "one" and you also lose your current score.
+ If you do not want to lose your current score, you can choose to "hold".
+ Clicking on "hold" means you also switch turns but your current score gets added to the total score.

In the current state, the winner is the first to get a score of 30.

### Improvements
I could make the game more fun in the future by implementing additional features like;
+ Giving user to set preferred winning score.
+ Giving user ability to choose if they would like to play with a die or two dice
+ Adding different modes. For instance a mode can have a slightly different rule that says the winner should get the exact number as the winning score. 
If they overshoot the winning score, the current score would be deducted from the total score instead of adding it.
